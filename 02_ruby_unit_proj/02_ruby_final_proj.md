# Fazia's Fruit Popsicles is a popsicle store in your neighborhood. Fazia takes fresh fruit like blueberries, raspberries, watermelon, and honeydew melon and turns them into a delicious, frozen treat. Fazia hired you to write a few programs for her. # 


1. The first program Fazia's popsicles would like you to create tells customers about the specials and sales. 


2. Create a variable `special` and set it equal to the value of `true`.


3. Create a variable `new_item` and set it equal to the value `'Honeydew Popsicle`'. 


4. Create a variable `special_price` and set it equal to a values of `4`. 


5. Under the `if` block on 


6. Create a variable `sale` and set it equal to true. Create two more variable `sale_item` and set it equal to `'Blueberry Popsicle'` and `sale_price` and set it equal to 2. 


7. Under the `if` block, 


8. Fauzia also needs a way to calculate the supplies that she has in stock. 

Each morning, Fazia recieve 60 cartons of 34 popsicles. 

Calculate the total number popsicles Fazia recieves in the morning and store the total number in a variable `morning_shipment` and output it to the terminal. 


9. Each afternoon, Fazia recieves 80 cartons of 24 popsicles. 

Calculate the total number popsicles Fazia recieves in the morning, store the number in a variable `afternoon_shipment` and ouput it to the terminal. 


10. The morning shipment and the afternoon shipment complete the number of popsicles Fazia recieves each day. 

Calculate the total number of popsicles Fazia recieves daily. Store the number in the variable `total_shipment` and output it to the terminal. 


11. If Fazia recieves 50 less popsicles on mondays, calculate the number of popsicles Fazia recieves on those days. Store the number in the variable `monday_shipment` and output it to the terminal. 


12. Fazia is printing a new, colorful banner for her wall. She wants it so that all the winter fruits are written in downcase.

Let's write a program for her banner. Create three variables, `apple`, `orange`, and `pomegranate` and set them equal to a string that describes the fruits name. 

Output all all of them to the screen so that they are downcased. 


13. Fazia decides that she wants all the tropical fruits to be in upcase. Create four variables `kiwi`, `lime`, `mango`, `pineapple`, `guava` and `banana` and set them equal to a string. 


14. Fazia decides she wants all the fruits that start with the letter B or the letter P to be reversed. 

Call the reverse method on these variables and output them to the screen. 


15. There was a huge rainstorm and Fazia's storage freezer was flooded. She won't be able to sell the kiwi or banana popsicles until a new shipment arrives the next day. 

You help her by commenting out these fruits and the output to the terminal until the new shipment arrives.
