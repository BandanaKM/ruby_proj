SpaceBnB is a new space hospitality company that arranges overnight accomodations in space. After some recent safety concerns, including the loss of several guests in space, the company's founder hired you to write a program for SpaceBnB staff to prepare guests in the event of an emergency. 


1. Our first program will help SpaceBnB staff to assist guests if planetary conditions become unfavorable. 

Write an `if` statement that outputs "Hand out sunscreen to all SpaceBnB guests" if the `daytime_temperature` is greater than 500. 

Test the statement on planet Cesium where the daytime_temp is 900.

```
if daytime_temp > 500
   puts "Hand out sunscreen to all SpaceBnB guests"
end 

daytime_temp = 900
```

2. Write an `if` statement that outputs "Hand out sweaters to all SpaceBnb guests" if the `nightime_temp` is less than 50. 

Test the statement on planet Neptunium where the `nighttime_temp` is -400. 

```
if nighttime_temp < 50
   puts "Hand out sweaters to all SpaceBnB guests"
end 

night_time < -400
```


3. Recently the strong gravitational pull on planets has made it difficult for visitors to handle their own mass. 

Write an `if.. else` statement. The statement should output "Offer gravitational suits to all SpaceBnb guests" if `gravity` is greater than 1. Otherwise it should output "Gravity is within safe range for humans."

Test out the statement on planet Palladium where the gravity is 10. 


if gravity > 1
  puts "Offer floatation suit to SpaceBnB guests"
else
  puts "The gravitational pull is within safe range"
end 


4. On other planets, the weak gravitational pull has resulted in cases of a few visitors floating away into space. 

The statement should output "Offer gravitational suits to all SpaceBnb guest" if the `gravity` is < 1. Otherwise it should output "Gravity is within safe range for humans."

Test it out on planet Cobalt where the gravity is 0.

```
if gravitational pull < 1
  puts "Offer heavy gravitation suit to SpaceBnB guests"
else 
  puts "The gravitational pull is within safe range"
end 
```

7. Due to a recent spate of inclement space weather events, SpaceBnB has requested that you write a few other programs for guests. 

Write an `unless` statement. When the `metor_shower` variable is set to `true`, the statement should output "Offer all guests meteor protection suit". Otherwise puts "Inform guests that they are safe from meteors today."

   unless meteor_shower = true 
     puts "Offer all SpaceBnB guests meteor protection suit" 
   else 
     puts "Inform guests that they are safe from meteors today"
   end 

Test it out on planet Strontium where there is currently a meteor shower. 


8. Write an `unless` statement. When the `volcanic` eruption is set to `true`, the statement should output "Offer all guests access to the volcano protection shelter". Otherwise puts "Inform guests that they are safe from volcanoes today."

unless volcanic_eruption = true 
     puts "Offer all guests access to the volcano protection shelter".
   else 
     puts "Inform guests that they are safe from volcanoes today."
   end 

Test it on planet Erbium where there is currently an active volcane.


9. Last year, SpaceBnB opened up accomodations on planet Cadmium. The safe level of oxygen for any planet is 5, while the oxygen level on planet Krypton is 10. 

Create a variable `breathable`, and set it equal to statement that comparies the safe levels of oxygen to the available oxygen on planet Cadmium using a less than operator. 


10. This year, SpaceBnB is opening up accomodations on planet Ferrous. The safe atmospheric pressure is 20, while the atmospheric pressure on planet Ferrous is 100. 

Create a variable `habitable`, and set it equal to a sttement that compares the safe atmospheric pressure to the atmopheric pressure on planet Ferrous using a greater than operator. 


11. The number of stars visible on planet Titanium is greater than or equal to the number of stars visible on planet Titanium. Create a variable `stars_visible` that compares the number of stars on both planets. 


12. The number of mountains on planet Xenon is less than or equal to the number of mountains on planet Radon. Create a variable `number_of_mountains` that compares the number of mountains on both planets. 


13. The number of moons on planet Neon is equal to the number of moons on planet Helium. Create a variable `number_of_moons` that demonstrates that both planets have an equal number of moons. 


14. The number of craters on planet Argon does not equal the number of craters on planet Krypton. Create a variable `number_of_craters` that demonstrates that the planets do not have an equal number of moons.

if it's this and this -- it's categorized as a dwarf planet. 



16. if it's this or this -- it's categorized as a whatever planet.
